The goal of this project is to create an interface that allows a user to store and manage music on their machine. Users will be able to create play lists, favorite certain songs, and sort songs by the artist, or the song name. Our goal with this project is to make a simple version of music applications like Spotify or iTunes, for people who don't like using their current music player application.

\section{Introduction}


Music is an everyday part of life, and many people go everyday without even thinking about the luxury that we have in the modern era, being able to listen to what we want, wherever we want to. Following this, there are many many platforms that one can use to access music. We aim to reproduce one such platform, creating an interface that allows someone to add music of their choosing, organize it, and play it. 
	
Providing people with more options is never a bad thing. Even if there are only a few things that differentiate one software from another, there are always going to be users looking for new experiences. We would like to be able to appeal to as wide an audience as possible, people who have problems with the existing flaws in other software, which are ignored or put off of being fixed by developers. Helping those people find a new place where they feel they can store their favorite songs can make a large difference, especially because music can be a very valuable, memorable resource for some people.

\subsection{Background}
Over the course of this proposal, we will use the term Metadata, and in this case, it's really just a technical term for basic music information. It pertains to things like album art, release date, track/song length, genre, artist, and the songs title.

We decided on a project like this because music is something that is easy to make connections between. Thankfully, The two of us had common ground in a genre that we used to listen to, but even if we didn't, it would be easy to come together to work on a project like this. It originally sprouted as an idea for an audio waveform visualizer, the flashing bars/lights that you'll see with music videos, that correspond to the beat of the song, or the lyrics. Neither of us have looked into what it takes to make those, and some further consideration led us to decide that it would be better to take a step back and just make a music management interface.

Andrew has run into problems with CDs on iTunes, so we hope to be able to implement a way transfer music from the manager to the CD, allowing the manager to effectively use and read CDs.

Kyle's main music application is Apple Music , and he has some issues with listening queue management, for example, shuffling a play list, and then adding it to the end of the list of what is currently being listened to, which is not possible in the application. If we could work the capability into this project, it may become an alternative listening application for him as well.

\subsection{Impacts}
There are many music managing systems on the internet, and we would like to see if we can create something worth telling others about, so that they can use as well. We want to add some functionality that gives us a chance to stand out, making it easier to reach even just a few people, and give them another place to handle the songs that they hold dear. It doesn't take much to brighten someone's day, and hopefully with this project we can manage to do that for a handful of people.

\subsection{Challenges}
Many of the troubles we were expecting to face when it came to distinguishing between files turned out to not be an issue. The file dialog that we were using came with previously implemented filtering methods, which prevented the user from choosing any files that we didn't want, and eliminated the source of our file concerns. Tying those files together so that an image file is associated with music file was also very easy to do with the arrays that we were working with, and would have been even simpler with a different storage method, like a list, which we were thankful for. Finally, unfortunately we were unable to spare the time and resources to create the waveform visualizer, but that's not really all too much to be worried about, since it was kind of a far off goal before we even started actual programming. We also considered trying to tie the manager to a database, but we realized that it would take up a large chunk of time to get functioning properly, and may have ended up preventing the user from adding any custom songs or songs that they made themselves, which wasn't something that we wanted.


\section{Scope}
Our project will be completed when we have an interface that allows the user to add songs of their choosing, modify their metadata, add those songs to play lists and edit those play lists freely and easily, search for songs within their database, and sort them by given data types, like artist, genre, and song title

We have some ideas for stretch goals. One of them would be implementing the previously mentioned audio waveform visualizer. Along with this, being able to easily export your play lists or songs to various different platforms would be very handy. Lastly, we would love to be able to implement a system that allows the user to upload images for artwork that will display when a song is playing, be it album art, or an image that will act as the cover of a given play list, allowing for more user customization.

\subsection{Requirements}
To decide on the requirements for our project, the two of us sat down and discussed the basics of what we needed to consider the application to be acceptable. Making a play list, adding and removing songs, and implementing a listening queue are a few examples. They are signified by having a priority of 1 in the use case table (See Table \ref{tab:useCaseIndex}). Afterwards, we talked about what we thought we be useful or unique features to try and include, which are signified by 2's and 3's in the table, depending on how important including them was.

\subsubsection{Functional}
\begin{itemize}
\item Store songs that are currently being played, and are queued to play
\item Keep track of previously played songs for accessibility later
\item Display current song being played, as well as associated artwork
\item Hold songs that are being played for storage across listening sessions
\item Give access to specific metadata, like genre or song name, allowing user to make changes
\item Allow for customization of user created play lists
\item Prevent duplication of music in library
\item Import/export songs from CD
\item Adhere to copyright laws, recognizing proper credit to musicians 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Non-Functional}
\begin{itemize}
\item When user adds, removes, reorders songs, update the list and storage methods quickly and accurately
\item Prevent user from selecting songs that aren't .mp3 or .wav files, and images that aren't .jpg or .png files
\item Ensure that songs and data are easily accessible and understandable to the user, through effective use of application interface
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interface Mockups}
Included below are some basic ideas for what the user will see in the program. Starting off, we have how the current interface looks, with theme options on the right, a section in the middle containing the song art, progress bar, labels for the current and total play times, a toolbar at the bottom, and the song list with some accompanying buttons on the right side. (See Figure \ref{CurInterface}). Following those are plans for how certain user interaction will look. First is adding a song to the song queue (See Figure \ref{AddQueue} which would be accessed by hovering over a song. Next, we have a mock up of how the user would add a song to the manager (See Figure \ref{AddSongAddArt}), by pressing a file button, giving the user the choice to add songs. The next figure is an idea of what it may look like when the user wants to tie an image to a song (See Figure \ref{AddSongAddArt}), a small button will appear that will open the file explorer when clicked, where the user can select an image to link to a song. After, we have a mock up of what the menu for interacting with a CD or other outside device may look like (See Figure \ref{PlayCD}), which would function in a similar manner to the file drop down box, but with options specific to outside devices. The last figure shows an option for volume control (See Figure \ref{VolumeButton}), where there will be simple plus and minus buttons that would adjust the volume by specific increments until a minimum or maximum is reached.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Project Structure}
The manager will be designed to keep things as simple as possible, which is both useful for the users, and easier on us for programming.

For example, we ended up opting for always having the song list displayed, instead of only having it displayed when a certain button is pressed. This makes things easier for the user to keep track of, and for us to keep track of when testing.

Along with that, all of the control still comes through the use of buttons, but not everything comes from buttons, like getting a progress bar for the song that is currently playing, with the current play time and total song length displayed on opposite sides, and changing volume using a slider. 

We removed the song list, album, and play lists classes, because there wasn't enough of a difference between the three to justify having them. Instead, the song names, locations, and user selected album art are all stored in their own arrays. This keeps things simple, and prevents unnecessary work. Now, When the user wants to create a play list, the current song list is saved to a selected location, and can be loaded later.

The database idea was put aside, mostly because the database we were planning on using is very large, which would prove inconvenient for users with storage space issues, and likely take a toll on operation time. On top of that, querying the database for songs whenever they are added means that any songs that the user themselves has made, are more than likely not going to be found within the data base, which would lead to some conflicts with sorting methods. To get around this, we have allowed the user to sort the song list by titles, and also have provided buttons to manually move the songs around the list, which makes the application more accessible.

\subsection{UML Outline}
The UML for the music manager turned out to present a decent number of challenges. Since the program ended up being primarily controlled by buttons and built in functionality, it was kind of difficult to effectively translate into a UML diagram. Below, the UML is split into 3 figures, (see Figures \ref{ButtonOutline}, \ref{AbsFactOutline}, \ref{DecOutline}). Starting out is the button outline, which describes the main functions of the program, controlled by buttons. We were nervous about the outcome of this UML, since it is not like any other UMLs that we've made, with no special classes or implementations, just button functions. As a result, it looks different from any previous outlines, which took some time to come to terms with.

\begin{figure}

\caption{UML outline of the abstract factory pattern used for light and dark themes}
\label{AbsFactOutline}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[height=250px, width=350px]{Decorator_Pattern.png}
\caption{UML outline of decorator pattern used to give song label more properties}
\label{DecOutline}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Design Patterns Used}
We decided to utilize two simple design patterns: and abstract factory pattern, and a decorator pattern (See Figures \ref{AbsFactOutline}, and \ref{DecOutline}, respectively). It would have been nice to try and use some more specific patterns, or ones that we had not practiced much, but it was difficult to work them into our project in a way that was useful, and couldn't just be implemented in a different, easier way. Even then, there were definitely other ways we could have gone about achieving the results of the patterns we used.

The abstract factory pattern (See Figure \ref{AbsFactOutline}) provides basic light and dark themes, creating the grid background, toolbar, and song label items in the respective theme forms. We chose to use this pattern to make themes because it makes sense to have some theme options with an application like this. There are many more theme options that we could have made, or can still add later, but we settled on light and dark themes for the time being to prevent the GUI from getting too crowded.

The second pattern we used was a decorator pattern (see Figure \ref{DecOutline}), which adds some more capability to the label that displays the name of the currently playing song. Normally the label would just show the user the name of the song, and updates as songs are changed. Using the decorator pattern, we added the ability to click the song label, which would change it from displaying the current song name, to displaying the song name, song path, and corresponding image path on the user's device. 
We thought this would be a useful way to implement the pattern, and it took the place of our original idea of playing a snippet of the song when the user selected it in the list. When trying to implement the original idea, we could not get the song to play for a set amount of time in an efficient manner. Along with this, after selecting a song and playing the snippet, the program would prevent the user from pressing any other buttons, which effectively rendered the application useless, so we chose to opt for the new label decorator instead.


\section{Results}
Looking back on our ideas for the project when we were first brainstorming, we made some pretty lofty goals, and some of them were out of the scope of the time that we had, and the capabilities of Visual Studio. For example, we wanted to be able to save the last song listened to, and the time that was left in the song, so that the user could pick back up at the same place after closing the application, but this didn't seem easily accomplished within our work space, so we had to give up on the idea. Similarly, exporting music to a CD would require burning the CD, which ends up being a large stretch for the bounds of this project. All things considered, however, we did manage to get a lot of our use cases functioning, and meet most of our goals. We gave the user the ability to load multiple songs into the manager, save them out as a play list. Then can then load in those play lists, make changes and save it again. The user can tie images to the songs all at one time, or change individual song images. They can then select a song and remove it, or move it up or down in the song list until they're satisfied. They can move to the next song or previous song, shuffle them, remove one song at a time, or clear the whole song list. Lastly, any art chosen for a song will always be displayed when the song is playing, which makes things less cluttered on the user interface, compared to the user selecting a song and choosing if they want to display the art.

\subsection{Future Work}
Unfortunately, the project will most likely not be making it's way out into the world, at least not anymore than it already is. It was a great way to practice what we've learned this semester, and to learn more about the capabilities of Visual Studio and WPF, but the project really doesn't put our best foot forward at this point, and doesn't have enough functionality that sets it apart from anything else that is already available. The manager may look good on a resume if either of us takes it further, and continues to work on it, but with the problems that we had finding time to work on it within the scope of this class, which gave us ample opportunity, it's unlikely that we'll have the free time to see it through to what we originally had hoped.
