The goal of this project is to create an interface that allows a user to store and manage music on their machine. Users will be able to create play lists, favorite certain songs, and sort songs by the artist, or the song name. Our goal with this project is to make a simple version of music applications like Spotify or iTunes, for people who don't like using their current music player application.

\section{Introduction}


Music is an everyday part of life, and many people go everyday without even thinking about the luxury that we have in the modern era, being able to listen to what we want, wherever we want to. Following this, there are many many platforms that one can use to access music. We aim to reproduce one such platform, creating an interface that allows someone to add music of their choosing, organize it, and play it. 
	
Providing people with more options is never a bad thing. Even if there are only a few things that differentiate one software from another, there are always going to be users looking for new experiences. We would like to be able to appeal to as wide an audience as possible, people who have problems with the existing flaws in other software, which are ignored or put off of being fixed by developers. Helping those people find a new place where they feel they can store their favorite songs can make a large difference, especially because music can be a very valuable, memorable resource for some people.

\subsection{Background}
Over the course of this proposal, we will use the term Metadata, and in this case, it's really just a technical term for basic music information. It pertains to things like album art, release date, track/song length, genre, artist, and the songs title.

We decided on a project like this because music is something that is easy to make connections between. Thankfully, The two of us had common ground in a genre that we used to listen to, but even if we didn't, it would be easy to come together to work on a project like this. It originally sprouted as an idea for an audio waveform visualizer, the flashing bars/lights that you'll see with music videos, that correspond to the beat of the song, or the lyrics. Neither of us have looked into what it takes to make those, and some further consideration led us to decide that it would be better to take a step back and just make a music management interface.

Andrew has run into problems with CDs on iTunes, so we hope to be able to implement a way transfer music from the manager to the CD, allowing the manager to effectively use and read CDs.

Kyle's main music application is Apple Music , and he has some issues with listening queue management, for example, shuffling a play list, and then adding it to the end of the list of what is currently being listened to, which is not possible in the application. If we could work the capability into this project, it may become an alternative listening application for him as well.

\subsection{Impacts}
There are many music managing systems on the internet, and we would like to see if we can create something worth telling others about, so that they can use as well. We want to add some functionality that gives us a chance to stand out, making it easier to reach even just a few people, and give them another place to handle the songs that they hold dear. It doesn't take much to brighten someone's day, and hopefully with this project we can manage to do that for a handful of people.

\subsection{Challenges}
It may be difficult to organize and handle the previously mentioned metadata, since there is a lot of information that goes along with it. We also may run into trouble trying to create a system to accept different file types, like .mp3 versus .mp4 versus .wav, but working a system like this out would prove very useful for attracting more users. Making a display for things like album art, and giving the user the option to upload their own art to go with songs or created play lists may also prove to be difficult, partially because of accepting images, and partially reaching back to accepting different image file types, like .jpeg and .png. Lastly, we are still sort of hoping to implement an audio waveform visualizer somewhere within the interface, and we think this will prove to be the biggest hurdle, especially if we can't find a framework to start with.


\section{Scope}
Our project will be completed when we have an interface that allows the user to add songs of their choosing, modify their metadata, add those songs to play lists and edit those play lists freely and easily, search for songs within their database, and sort them by given data types, like artist, genre, and song title

We have some ideas for stretch goals. One of them would be implementing the previously mentioned audio waveform visualizer. Along with this, being able to easily export your play lists or songs to various different platforms would be very handy. Lastly, we would love to be able to implement a system that allows the user to upload images for artwork that will display when a song is playing, be it album art, or an image that will act as the cover of a given play list, allowing for more user customization.

\subsection{Requirements}
To decide on the requirements for our project, the two of us sat down and discussed the basics of what we needed to consider the application to be acceptable. Making a play list, adding and removing songs, and implementing a listening queue are a few examples. They are signified by having a priority of "1" in the use case table (See Table \ref{tab:useCaseIndex}). Afterwards, we talked about what we thought we be useful or unique features to try and include, which are signified by "2"s and "3"s in the table, depending on how important including them was.

\subsubsection{Functional}
\begin{itemize}
\item Store songs that are currently being played, and are queued to play
\item Keep track of previously played songs for accessibility later
\item Display current song being played, as well as associated artwork
\item Hold songs that are being played for storage across listening sessions
\item Give access to specific metadata, like genre or song name, allowing user to make changes
\item Allow for customization of user created play lists
\item Prevent duplication of music in library
\item Import/export songs from CD
\item Adhere to copyright laws, recognizing proper credit to musicians 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Non-Functional}
\begin{itemize}
\item When user updates music information, efficiently adjust related processes
\item Ensure that music and image files are of proper file formatting
\item Ensure that songs and data are easily accessible and understandable to the user, through effective use of application interface
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Use Cases}
Use Case index can be seen in Table \ref{tab:useCaseIndex}.

\section{Project Structure}
At first, this will be a little empty (it will need to be filled in by the time you turn in your final report).  This is your chance to discuss all of your design decisions (consider this the README's big brother).

\subsection{UML Outline}
The music manager will be designed with a facade in mind (see Figure \ref{UMLOutline}), allowing the user to access various sections of the manager from the GUI, hopping from play lists to albums, via the use of navigational buttons. Users will be able to access their song queue through a similarly structured button, or skip/repeat songs at their leisure with arrow buttons. A play button will allow the user to pause or play whatever song they are currently listening to. 
Underneath the facade, there will be song classes that contain the song information that is linked to a database, which will be queried when the user adds a song through the file button. The user will then be able to add any music in their library to a play list, which will function like a list of songs, similar to the album class.
The song class itself will contain variables the correspond to data, like song length, song and artist names, and album art. This information will be provided by the database query, assuming that the song the user is adding can be found within the database. This prevents the user from entering false information, which is both good for accurate user information, and makes sure that no one can ignore copyright laws, and cause trouble for us and themselves.

\caption{Your figures should be in the \emph{figure} environment, and have captions.  Should also be of diagrams pertaining to your project, not random internet kittens}
\label{cat2}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Design Patterns Used}
Make sure to actually use at least 2 design patterns from this class.  This is not normally part of such documentation, but largely just specific to this class -- I want to see you use the patterns!


\section{Results}
This section will start out a little vague, but it should grow as your project evolves.  With each deliverable you hand in, give me a final summary of where your project stands.  By the end, this should be a reflective section discussing how many of your original goals you managed to attain/how many desired use cases you implemented/how many extra features you added.

\subsection{Future Work}
Where are you going next with your project?
For early deliverables, what are your next steps?  (HINT: you will typically want to look back at your timeline and evaluate: did you meet your expected goals?  Are you ahead of schedule?  Did you decide to shift gears and implement a new feature?)
By the end, what do you plan on doing with this project?  Will you try to sell it?  Set it on fire?  Link to it on your resume and forget it exists?
